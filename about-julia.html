                I love being a Russian girl in STEM. There were usually barely any other girls in my classes, and that 
                made me feel special. I was rare. When I was on the plane last time I went to Russia, I was sitting
                next to this Russian woman. We got to talking and she asked me what I study. My response was Computer Science.
                She goes "What?! Girls don't do that here." By "here" she meant Russia. I have never felt more special in my life.
